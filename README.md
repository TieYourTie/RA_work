# Price Stickiness & Trend Inflation Data Processing

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of my work as a **Research Assistant at Carleton University** under the supervision of **Professor Hashmat Khan**. It focuses on **price stickiness and trend inflation theory**, utilizing GDP data from multiple sources, including:  

- 📊 **OECD**  
- 🌍 **World Bank**  
- 🏦 **International Financial Statistics (IFS)**  
- 🌐 **United Nations (UN)**  

The project involves collecting, cleaning, processing, and visualizing GDP data while resolving **naming inconsistencies** across datasets.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Multi-Source Data Integration** – Standardizes GDP data from various sources.  
✅ **Automated Data Cleaning** – Identifies and resolves discrepancies in naming conventions.  
✅ **Cross-Dataset Processing** – Implements a **dictionary-based solution** in **R and MATLAB** for seamless merging.  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Uses R to analyze and visualize trends in price stickiness and inflation.

## ⚡ Challenges & Solutions  

### 🛑 Problem  
When working with multiple datasets, inconsistent naming conventions across sources created **integration issues**.  

### 💡 Solution  
Developed a **dictionary-based program** in **R and MATLAB** that **maps inconsistent country and variable names**, allowing for efficient **cross-dataset processing** and **improving data integrity**.
