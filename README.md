Overview

This project, conducted as part of my Research Assistant role at Carleton University under the supervision of Professor Hashmat Khan, focuses on price stickiness and trend inflation theory. It involves collecting, cleaning, processing, and visualizing GDP data from multiple sources, including the OECD, World Bank, IFS, and UN.

Key Features
	•	Multi-Source Data Integration: Aggregates GDP data from diverse sources while handling inconsistencies in naming conventions.
	•	Automated Data Cleaning: Identifies and resolves discrepancies across datasets for seamless analysis.
	•	Cross-Dataset Processing: Implements a dictionary-based solution in R and MATLAB to standardize country and variable names.
	•	Visualization & Analysis: Leverages R for data visualization to examine trends in price stickiness and inflation.

Technologies Used
	•	R: Data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
	•	MATLAB: Additional dataset standardization and analysis.
