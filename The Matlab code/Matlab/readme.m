%now, all the data clearning and processing part are able to funcation
%automatrically in teh main_program.

%This README file provides a guide on how to use the code within this file.

%% Part One: Setting Up the File

%1. To run the following code, you will need functional MATLAB software.
    % If you have opened this file in MATLAB, congratulations, you are one-third of the way done.

%2. On the left side of the MATLAB code editor, you should see something called "Current Folder."

%3. Left-click or click "MATLAB" at the top of the code editor. 
 % Then, look at the left side of the code editor. 
 % Right-click (or two-finger click on a touchpad) in the "Current Folder" area to bring up the context menu. 
 % Then click "Show in Finder" to locate where your MATLAB code is saved.

%4. Drag this code file into the "Current Folder."

%% Part Two: Index of the File

%1. First, please run the data processing code. This code will clean and process all the data necessary for the main code to run correctly.

%2. The "function" folder contains important functions used for data processing.

%By following these steps, you will ensure that the MATLAB code is set up correctly and ready to use.
